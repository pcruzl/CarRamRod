# BlackJackFX

A simple blackjack game by some people that runs on **Java 8** and **JavaFX 4**.


# Instructions

## Installation

Go to the `releases` tab on GitHub and download the latest release. Double click the downloaded `.jar` file to execute the program.

## Game play
The goal of the game is to not have the sum of your cards go over the number **21**, while also having a total sum that is higher than that of the dealers' sum.

You have the choice to either **hit** or **stand** during each progression of the game. You should choose to **hit** if you believe that the total sum of your cards will not go over the number `21`. You should choose to **stand** if you believe that the dealer will go over the number `21` when they hit, or if you believe that hitting will cause you to loose the game.
